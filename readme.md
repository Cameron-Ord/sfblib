# SFBLIB
## A simple 2D graphics library that writes pixels to a CPU framebuffer

TODO:
1. Finish implementing multithreading (Posix threads is mostly done, There is currently not any code for Windows using CreateProcess)
2. Implement a simple lighting system/engine.
3. De expose specific functions and make the API more friendly
